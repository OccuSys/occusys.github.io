# Occupant-Centric Energy Systems (OccuSys)

## Modeling and Control Beyond Static Boundaries

### ACM BuildSys 2026 · Banff, Canada

<div class="callout">
The energy transition presents unprecedented opportunities to rethink how we model, predict, and respond to occupant behavior. From personalized thermal comfort control and human-in-the-loop systems to data-driven behavior prediction and adaptive building automation, emerging technologies enable buildings to become truly occupant-centric.
